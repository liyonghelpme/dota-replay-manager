## Overview ##
DotA Replay Manager is a tool for browsing Warcraft III replays with lots of additional features for parsing DotA replays.

## History ##
I started this tool back in 2007, and released the first version on December 31th 2007. Since then, it has been greatly expanded, and is currently at 2.10, found in the [PlayDota topic](http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8624).

Recently, I decided to rewrite the tool from scratch, for several reasons. First, I've lost the latest source (I still have a backup of 2.09). Second, the code wasn't initially designed well, and as it grew over the years, it's become nearly impossible to maintain.
This is the page for new and rewritten version, and I'll be updating it regularly.

Currently, there aren't many major changes compared to the previous version, but there are tons of interface improvements and increased stability. The biggest change is that all the source is available here, at Google code (including the old version in the old\_src directory).
